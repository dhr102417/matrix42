He remains a defendant in a lawsuit filed against him, Trump\u2019s attorney Ken Chesebro and the 10 fake Republican electors.<\/p>\n<p>The electors\u00a0agreed to a settlement in the lawsuit, but Troupis and Chesebro remain defendants.<\/p>\n<p>Troupis has been a member of the\u00a0Judicial Conduct Advisory Committee\u00a0since 2020. The committee is charged with giving formal opinions and informal advice to judges and judicial officers related to the code of judicial conduct. The advice involves whether possible actions would be in compliance with the state\u2019s judicial code of conduct.<\/p>\n<p>The committee rarely issues formal written opinions and has not issued one since 2019, according to its website.<\/p>\n<p>Troupis\u2019s place on the panel advising judges about possible ethical violations is improper given his involvement with the fake elector scheme, said Mike Browne, deputy director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe never should have been reappointed after his role in the MAGA conspiracy to undermine our freedom was public,\u201d Browne said in a statement, referring to the Trump campaign slogan \u201cMake America great again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he certainly shouldn\u2019t continue to serve in any position of public trust now. If he doesn\u2019t have the decency to step down on his own, the right-wing justices who wrongly supported his re-appointment should step in and remove him,\u201d Browne said.<\/p>\n<p>Calls for Troupis to be replaced on the judicial commission\u00a0echo those from Democrats\u00a0who want one of the fake electors, Bob Spindell, to be removed from the bipartisan state elections commission. But the Republican Senate majority leader who appointed Spindell has refused to rescind the appointment.<\/p>\n<p>Troupis was reappointed to serve on the judicial ethics panel in March by four conservative members of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, including three who remain on the court.<\/p>\n<p>Neither Troupis nor the justices who appointed him \u2014 Chief Justice Annette Ziegler and justices Rebecca Bradley and Brian Hagedorn \u2014 replied to messages seeking comment.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nHUNTER BIDENFormer Trump aide asks judge to dismiss Hunter Biden lawsuit tied to laptop<br \/>\n2024 ELECTIONNevada GOP leaders indicted in pro-Trump \u2018fake elector\u2019 case still in charge of caucus planning<\/p>\n<p>Winnebago County Circuit Judge Bryan Keberlein, who chairs the judicial advisory committee, was not available for comment.<\/p>\n<p>President Joe Biden won Wisconsin in 2020. Trump\u2019s campaign tried to overturn the results by arguing, in\u00a0lawsuits filed by Troupis, that tens of thousands of absentee ballots legally cast should not have counted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u00a0rejected the Trump lawsuit\u00a0on a 4-3 ruling, upholding Biden\u2019s win.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the lawsuits, Troupis also was involved with the fake elector scheme in Wisconsin.<\/p>\n<p>Fake electors in Wisconsin and six other battleground states sent certificates to Congress falsely declaring Trump the winner of the 2020 presidential election, despite confirmed results showing he had lost.<\/p>\n<p>The scheme began in Wisconsin, according to prosecutors who brought a\u00a0four-count indictment released against Trump\u00a0in August.<\/p>\n<p>Chesebro wrote in a Dec. 13, 2020, email that the strategy \u201cwas not to use the fraudulent electors only in the circumstance that the Defendant\u2019s litigation was successful in one of the targeted states.\u201d Instead, he wrote, \u201cthe plan was to falsely present the fraudulent slates as an alternative to the legitimate slates at Congress\u2019s certification proceeding.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Georgia indictment\u00a0of Trump refers to Chesebro\u2019s memo to Troupis as an \u201covert act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After Wisconsin\u2019s fake electors met on Dec. 14, 2020, Troupis contacted U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s staff and asked that Johnson\u00a0deliver the documents from the fake electors\u00a0in Wisconsin and Michigan to Vice President Mike Pence. A Pence staff member refused to accept them.<\/p>\n<p>On Dec. 6,\u00a0Nevada became the third state\u00a0to charge electors, following Michigan and\u00a0Georgia. Wisconsin Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has repeatedly refused to say whether there is an ongoing criminal investigation related to the state\u2019s fake electors, Troupis and Chesebro.<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0the recent legal settlement, the 10 fake electors admitted Biden had won the election and their efforts were part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 results. Under the deal, the fake electors didn\u2019t pay any damages or attorneys fees, or admit wrongdoing or liability.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jim Troupis, a former judge, was deeply involved in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn Wisconsin\u2019s 2020 election results.

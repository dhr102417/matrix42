The letter is written by Ferguson and states that &#8220;one of my top priorities is protecting consumers from fraud and deception. When corporations do not play by the rules, my team and I take action. I am returning the money to Washingtonians, like you, who were harmed by their illegal conduct.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"tnt-ads-container text-center\">\n<div id=\"tnt-smart-ad-1\" class=\"tnt-ads dfp-smart-ad\" data-google-query-id=\"CPOI0b3fooMDFe4TtwAdPY0D2A\">\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, an ethics complaint filed with the State Ethics Board and obtained by The Center Square argues that this constituted an illegal use of taxpayer dollars to support Ferguson&#8217;s gubernatorial campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;Bob Ferguson decided to send checks to hundreds of thousands or millions of lower-income people, giving them a portion of the settlement with chicken and tuna companies,&#8221; the complaint states. &#8220;He put his names on the check as the payer, AND he attached a letter to the checks that is blatant and illegal campaigning with public funds.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The complaint further alleges that it is a &#8220;blatant violation&#8221; of state\u00a0<\/span><strong>law<\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0&#8220;for Ferguson, during an active campaign for governor, to send money to voters and have the checks indicate that it is coming from him by name and to include a letter extolling his virtues. It is absolutely, undeniably, attempting to buy people&#8217;s votes.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to emails obtained by The Center Square, the ethics complaint has been sent to the State Auditor&#8217;s Office to avoid a conflict of interest, as the State Ethics Board is staffed by AGO employees.

We serve the people, and it is important that Washington taxpayers know the work that is being done on their behalf. This has been standard since at least 2013. We have provided more than $200 million in direct restitution to Washingtonians during this time.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(The Center Square) &#8211; Earlier this month, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced that he would send $40 million of taxpayer dollars recovered from a recent lawsuit settlement to 402,000 Washington households in the form of $50 and $120 checks.

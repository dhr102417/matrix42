I grew up poor in Arizona, and I believe\u2026that the \u2018American Dream\u2019 is real and it\u2019s the coolest freakin\u2019 thing on Earth. It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re born or how poor you are or what station in life or what your status is, if you want to, you can find opportunities in this fantastic country to do things that no one else can do and you can change your station.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Washington voters have directly voted down an income tax 10 times at the ballot box over the past 100 years, in 1934, 1936, 1938, 1942, 1944, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1982 and 2010.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow many times do voters need to tell lawmakers to stop with income taxes once and for all?\u201d Heywood said. \u201cOnce politicians\u2019 budgets take a hit from people like Bezos taking their money to Florida, who do you think will be the target of the next big tax? Small business owners, homeowners, young entrepreneurs, hard-working restaurant and family farm employers and regular, hardworking taxpayers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Heywood was making reference to billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announcing in November that he plans to\u00a0<strong>move<\/strong>\u00a0from Washington to Florida to be closer to his parents.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2022, Washington implemented a 7% tax on the sale of financial assets\u00a0despite a legal challenge.

Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, and chair of the Washington State Republican Party, told The Center Square.<\/p>\n<p>He said ordinary people aren\u2019t buying the narrative of the capital gains tax proponents that the rich aren\u2019t paying their fair share of taxes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey know the capital gains tax is an income tax, and they know there\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d Walsh continued. \u201cThey\u2019re going to keep a high threshold initially.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a reference to at least one Democrat \u2013 Sen.

Whitehead said inflation had \u201ceroded\u201d workers\u2019 wages and that an increase would help in retaining and recruiting qualified employees.<\/p>\n<p>Councilman Tim Hattenburg said the suggested increase was still below the current rate of inflation \u2013 3.4% was cited \u2013 and he proposed a 3% pay raise instead.<\/p>\n<p>In response, fellow councilman Ben Wick voiced concern about impacts to the 2024 budget, which will fund 116 full time-equivalent employees.<\/p>\n<p>Wick said the city has \u201csome amazing individuals on staff\u201d and that he appreciated their hard work. \u201cBut we do have some budget pressures,\u201d said Wick, referring to rising costs in other areas including significant increases in new parks maintenance contracts.<\/p>\n<p>Whitehead said increasing from 2.5% to 3% would cost the city an estimated $70,000 in additional expense next year.<\/p>\n<p>Council member Brandi Peetz asked, \u201cWhere do we get the money to do that?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finance director Chelsie Taylor said the city\u2019s capital reserve fund has about $4 million available, although those monies are typically used for one-time projects.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do have room in the recurring budget,\u201d she told the council, but added that any continuing use \u201cwould be a future concern.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\" class=\"tncms-region hidden-print\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThis is tough,\u201d said Peetz, who also called city staff \u201camazing\u201d but questioned if an additional 0.5% increase would provide much economic help after taxes and whether the money would be better spent on facilities which benefit employees.<\/p>\n<p>Councilman Arne Woodard and mayor Pam Haley both echoed Whitehead\u2019s comments on the need for a wage scale that serves to both recruit and retain employees. Haley supported the 3% increase, saying it would not match the current inflation rate \u201cbut it\u2019s close.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would give more if I could,\u201d said the mayor, lauding Spokane Valley employees for productivity comparable to other cities around the state with much-larger staffs.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the 3% pay increase was approved in a 5-2 vote, with Haley, Hattenburg, Woodard, Peetz and deputy Rod Higgins in support. Wick and council member Laura Padden dissented.<\/p>\n<p>During an earlier public comment period, a few citizens suggested using the $70,000 difference as a start in adding to the city\u2019s police force.<\/p>\n<p>Haley said the annual cost to fund one officer\u2019s position is double that amount, and that the council and city administrators have been working with the police department to add personnel in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe love cops,\u201d said Woodard, but added that bolstering the police department will be an \u201cincremental\u201d process.<\/p>\n<p>In November, city staff recommended increasing personnel in the police force, but no cost figures were factored into the 2024 budget as adopted. At the time, deputy city manager Erik Lamb said costs should be part of a \u201ccomprehensive discussion\u201d involving the council and police chief Dave Ellis to determine the department\u2019s immediate and long-term staffing needs, expenses, and revenue sources.<\/p>\n<p>The council\u2019s Dec. 19 meeting agenda and video can be viewed\u00a0<strong>here<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(The Center Square) \u2013 After extended discussion Tuesday evening, Spokane Valley City Council members approved a 3% wage increase for employees that takes effect in 2024.

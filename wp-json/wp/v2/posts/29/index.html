It&#8217;s the same fear other Republicans have noted in elected officials.<\/p>\n<p>By\u00a0Alex Tabet<\/p>\n<p>IOWA CITY, Iowa \u2014 Anti-Donald Trump Republicans know they are in the middle of a critical moment to stop the former president\u2019s political comeback. But for some, the steep cost of voicing resistance to Trump often renders them silent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you go against Trump, like \u2014 you\u2019re over,\u201d said Kyle Clare, 20, a member of the University of Iowa\u2019s College Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk about Donald Trump a lot because I\u2019m afraid of the backlash,\u201d said Jody Sears, 66, a registered Republican from Grimes, Iowa.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you would say something negative about Trump, we had one person that would just go bang for your throat,\u201d said Barbra Spencer, 83, a former Trump voter describing her experience living in senior apartments in Spillville, Iowa.<\/p>\n<p>Trump still enjoys broad popularity in the Republican Party, and that\u2019s driving his polling leads among Republicans in Iowa, New Hampshire and every other state ahead of the 2024 primaries. But he has also used that popularity to enforce unity. And the same impulse that has led Republican officeholders to avoid criticizing Trump because of potential threats to their safety and their jobs is also holding back rank-and-file voters from opposing the former president in public with the full strength of their personal convictions.<\/p>\n<p>NBC News spoke to more than a half-dozen Iowa voters turned off by Trump \u2014 but some were anxious about talking on the record out of fear of being shunned by friends or family. One Iowan said they plan on saying they caucused for Trump when asked by members of their community but will actually caucus for Vivek Ramaswamy.<\/p>\n<p>That adds up to signs going unplaced on front lawns, conversations with friends and family about other candidates avoided \u2014 and fewer opportunities for opposition to Trump to take hold in different Republican communities.<\/p>\n<p>NBC News first spoke with Clare in a University of Iowa auditorium Aug. 23, the night of the first GOP presidential debate. Fellow College Republicans were reacting to the debate and voicing steadfast support for the GOP candidate who wasn\u2019t on the stage: Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Clare chose to wait until the end of the night, after the rest of his classmates left the auditorium, to share his thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just so scared of doing this right now,\u201d he said, fighting back tears. \u201cI want to be able to have my opinions on our politicians, and I want to be able to speak freely about them and people still understand I\u2019m a conservative.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Clare criticized Trump, particularly for his actions Jan. 6, 2021, saying, \u201cThe end of his administration was un-American.\u201d He also said Trump\u2019s supporters are in denial about losing the 2020 election.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want to believe he lost the election. It\u2019s hard to swallow. Losing is hard to swallow. But it\u2019s important that when we lose, we recognize that we lost and we think, \u2018What can we do better next time to win over Americans?\u2019\u201d Clare said.<\/p>\n<p>Clare was right to expect backlash from speaking out on Trump. After NBC News published the interview with him on a \u201cMeet The Press\u201d social media account, hateful and homophobic comments poured in. Clare said later that a student came up to him at a university event, shoved a phone in his face with the video on it, and asked him why he\u2019s \u201cscared of Trump and not scared of getting AIDS from having gay sex.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSay something they disagree with, and they go after your sexuality,\u201d said Clare, who added that he doesn\u2019t regret doing the interview with NBC News. Many of the comments questioned if Clare \u2014 who holds a leadership role at the University of Iowa\u2019s College Republican organization, interned for a Republican on Capitol Hill, and is heavily involved in the Johnson County, Iowa, GOP \u2014 was truly a Republican.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it shouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for me to say I am conservative and that I think there are other options, and I don\u2019t think that this person is good for our country,\u201d Clare said. But he\u2019s worried those opinions will stunt his own long-term political ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf people as powerful and as prominent as members of Congress can be taken down because of their criticisms of one man, what\u2019s stopping that from happening to me?\u201d Clare noted, referring to the Republicans ousted from Congress after voting to impeach Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s criticism forced several senators and House members into retirement or primary defeat during his first years in office. Later, of the 10 House Republicans who voted to bring impeachment charges against Trump following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, four retired before facing voters in 2022 and another four lost their next primaries. Only two remain in the House.<\/p>\n<p>In the Senate, three of the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump have since retired or resigned, and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah is retiring next year.<\/p>\n<p>Romney recounted to biographer McKay Coppins\u00a0that Republican members of Congress confided to him they wanted Trump impeached and convicted but would vote against the charges because they were worried about threats to their families.<\/p>\n<p>Full Sen. Mitt Romney: Trump\u2019s campaign one of \u2018retribution, anger and hate\u2019<br \/>\nDEC. 10, 202321:03<\/p>\n<p>Former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of the Republicans who lost a 2022 primary after voting to impeach Trump, detailed similar conversations in her new memoir.<\/p>\n<p>Cheney wrote about one colleague that she \u201cabsolutely understood his fear\u201d about what would happen if he voted to impeach Trump. But, she continued, \u201cI also thought, \u2018Perhaps you need to be in another job.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2018It was easier to be quiet about it\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Rank-and-file voters are less prominent and thus less likely to be harassed or threatened, but some of the same worries and experiences remain. Sears, the Republican from Grimes, Iowa, feels Trump doesn\u2019t reflect her values. But that\u2019s an opinion she kept to herself until recently, because of the fear of being cast off by family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nHUNTER BIDENFormer Trump aide asks judge to dismiss Hunter Biden lawsuit tied to laptop<br \/>\n2024 ELECTIONNevada GOP leaders indicted in pro-Trump \u2018fake elector\u2019 case still in charge of caucus planning<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFamily and people I work with are Trump supporters,\u201d said Sears, describing her hesitancy to speak out about her beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think Trump supporters tried to coerce or bully people into also being Trump supporters. And so it was easier to be quiet about it,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Spencer, a retiree now living in a nursing home in Decorah, Iowa, says Trump supporters at her previous retirement community created a toxic environment that stopped her and her friends from voicing opinions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were afraid of arguments,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you live with that many old people, sometimes they have very strange but very firm thoughts and you better think the way they do,\u201d she said, explaining her silence.<\/p>\n<p>Clare, Sears and Spencer are not the only people who feel this way.<\/p>\n<p>And as Cheney and Romney\u2019s stories demonstrate, social ostracization isn\u2019t limited to just voters who speak out against Trump. Former Rep. Denver Riggleman, a Republican who represented a slice of Virginia from 2019 to 2021, says his mother texted him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were ever elected,\u201d after he came out against Trump.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was so soul-crushing to have a family member choose Donald Trump over you,\u201d Riggleman continued. He said evangelical Trump supporters in his life saw Trump as being blessed by God. \u201cI was going directly against religious beliefs. And that\u2019s a losing battle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s now been almost six months since a member of Congress endorsed a non-Trump candidate in the 2024 GOP primary, according to NBC News\u2019 endorsement tracking.<\/p>\n<p>The trend has popped up elsewhere on the 2024 campaign trail, too. When Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds endorsed Ron DeSantis in November, the Florida governor\u00a0mentioned in an interview with NBC News\u00a0that he \u201chad people come to me and say they endorsed [Trump] because of the threats and everything like that\u201d during the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Trump quickly went after Reynolds after news of her DeSantis endorsement broke,\u00a0posting on social media that it would \u201cbe the end of her political career.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Iowa Gov. Reynolds endorses Gov. DeSantis for president: Trump \u2018can\u2019t win\u2019 in 2024<br \/>\nNOV. 7, 202323:00<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Vortex of controversy and vilification\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Charlie Sykes was a conservative radio show host in Wisconsin for more than 20 years before Trump burst onto the political scene. Sykes was skeptical and critical of Trump, eventually\u00a0confronting him in a heated interview\u00a0about insults Trump hurled at Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s wife in 2016. But for Sykes, it began to become clear that there was no room anymore for anti-Trump conservatives on talk radio.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe audience of conservative talk radio began to think that loyalty was required. They wanted conservative media to be a safe space for them,\u201d Sykes said, describing how his role became untenable.<\/p>\n<p>After leaving radio, Sykes didn\u2019t let up on his Trump criticism, which he says got him booted from a think tank and led him to lose friends and become a self-described political orphan. He says his criticism was met with bullying \u2014 and he understands why people who don\u2019t work in the public eye might be hesitant to voice their true feelings about Trump.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do understand why people in their normal lives don\u2019t want to be caught up in this vortex of controversy and vilification \u2014 why they would step back from all of this,\u201d Sykes said.<\/p>\n<p>Another longtime Wisconsin Republican recently detailed one of the results of that pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Former House Speaker Paul Ryan\u00a0recently spoke on video at an event for Teneo, a global consulting firm where he serves as vice-chair. Ryan said the impulse to avoid getting on the wrong side of angry Trump supporters pushed former colleagues to vote against impeachment even though they wanted Trump gone \u2014 and now he thinks there are many who regret those votes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey figured, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna take this heat and I\u2019m going to vote against this impeachment because he\u2019s gone anyway,\u2019\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened is that he\u2019s been resurrected.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some anti-Trump voters say the social cost of speaking out can be too high to take the risk.

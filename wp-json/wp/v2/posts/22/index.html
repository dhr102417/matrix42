Schwerin did not respond to requests for comment.<\/p>\n<p>The records released describe the dates of the emails and who exchanged them, but do not include the messages themselves. NBC News has not reviewed the contents of the emails.<\/p>\n<p>All told, then-Vice President Biden emailed Schwerin 35 times before and after his 2014 trips to Ukraine. Five emails were exchanged just prior to a trip by Vice President Biden to Ukraine on June 7, 2014, and 27 emails were sent from the end of June to a second trip to Ukraine by Biden on Nov. 21, 2014.<\/p>\n<p>The bulk of the communication occurred in the lead-up to and following an agreement for Hunter Biden to serve on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in a news release that Schwerin told House Ways and Means Committee staff in a March interview that the elder Biden was not involved in the business of his son or any of his relatives.<\/p>\n<p>Raskin said Schwerin stated that \u201che was not aware of any involvement by President Biden in the financial conduct of the President\u2019s relatives\u2019 businesses, much less any transactions into or out of the then-vice president\u2019s bank account related to business conducted by any Biden family member.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The email disclosures were part of law enforcement records released by House Republicans following the testimony of IRS whistleblower Joseph Ziegler. This month, Ziegler provided the documents to the House Ways and Means Committee\u00a0in conjunction with a sworn affidavit. The committee, which also heard the testimony of a second IRS whistleblower, Gary Shapley, is led by Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo.<\/p>\n<p>Ziegler told Congress that \u201cthere were multiple emails found with Hunter Biden and his business associates\u201d but the investigative team was unaware at the time that then-Vice President Biden used an alias in his private emails.<\/p>\n<p>Recommended<br \/>\nU.S. NEWSBody found in trunk of burning car in California<br \/>\n#METOO RECKONINGLawsuit alleges Vin Diesel sexually assaulted his assistant in 2010<\/p>\n<p>Hunter Biden earned nearly $1.2 million from Burisma in 2014, according to emails contained on a copy of his hard drive and\u00a0obtained\u00a0by NBC News. In their recent tax indictment of Biden, federal prosecutors alleged he made over $1.4 million from 2016 to 2019, when Biden\u2019s engagement with the Ukrainian firm ended.<\/p>\n<p>Biden is scheduled to be arraigned on misdemeanor and\u00a0felony federal tax charges\u00a0in Los Angeles in early January. After his indictment last week, Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement, \u201cAfter five years of investigating with no new evidence \u2014 and two years after Hunter paid his taxes in full \u2014 the U.S. Attorney has piled on nine new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Biden\u2019s addition to Burisma\u2019s board as head of legal affairs was reported in a news release in May 2014. At some point from May to December 2014, Burisma\u00a0allegedly paid a bribe\u00a0to a Ukrainian official to help stop a joint British-U.S. money-laundering investigation into Burisma\u2019s top executive, according to a State Department email that quotes a Ukrainian prosecutor.<\/p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that Joe Biden helped oust a Ukrainian prosecutor, Victor Shokin, when he was \u201cprosecuting\u201d Burisma. Multiple U.S. officials testified to Congress that Shokin was forced out in a joint American and British effort because he himself was corrupt.<\/p>\n<p>Hunter Biden later wrote in his 2021 book, &#8220;Beautiful Things: A Memoir,&#8221; that few of his business deals brought tangible results. He said he wasn\u2019t \u201cdesperate\u201d before he landed a position on the board of Burisma in 2014 but that the money was \u201chelpful\u201d and that it came at a \u201cfortuitous\u201d time.<\/p>\n<p>He said it meant he didn\u2019t have to work hard to find clients, \u201cthe most time-consuming part of my work \u2014 drilling twenty dry wells to finally hit pay dirt,\u201d and that it allowed him to spend more time with his dying brother, Beau.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Democrats say the emails were routine and that Hunter Biden\u2019s business associate worked as Joe Biden\u2019s financial adviser and helped the then-vice president file his tax returns.
